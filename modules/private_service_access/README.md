# Submodule for VPC peering Cloud SQL services

MySQL [Private IP](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip)
configurations require a special peering between your VPC network and a
VPC managed by Google. The module supports creating such a peering.

It is sufficient to instantiate this module once for all MySQL instances
that are connected to the same VPC.

> NOTE: See the linked [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip)
> for all requirements for accessing a MySQL instance via its Private IP.
