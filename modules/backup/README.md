# GCP CloudSQL Backup

## Internal Backups

Cloud SQL provides an [internal default backup options](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/backup-recovery/backups#automated-backups).
This supports standard use-cases. (One Backup ~ every 24h stored for up to 365 days).

For many use cases this might be enough but for many other not:
e.g. for SQL Server there is currently no Point-in-time Recovery (PITR) available so you might want to take more updates.
Or your instance is not that critical and to [save costs](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/backup-recovery/backups#what_backups_cost) you are fine with one backup every 7 days.

> **Note**: To enable or disable the internal backups use the Terraform variable `enable_internal_backup`

For internal backups the workflow also takes care about deleting the old backups.

## Exports to GCS

But the backups mentioned above are bound to the SQL instance.
This means as soon as you [delete the instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/delete-instance) you are also loosing your backups.
To avoid this you can also export data. There is a second workflow doing exactly that.

> **Note**: To enable or disable the exports to GCS Buckets use the Terraform variable `enable_export_backup`

### Deleting old exports

The export workflow does not take care about deleting old backups. Please take care about that yourself.
You can use [Object Lifecycle Management](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle) to delete old exports.

## Required APIs

- `workflows.googleapis.com`
- `cloudscheduler.googleapis.com`

## Monitoring

Monitoring your exports/backups is not part of this module.
Please ensure that you monitor for failed workflows to ensure you have regular backups/exports.

A good metric could be to monitor for workflow executions that not succeeded:

```mql
fetch workflows.googleapis.com/Workflow
| metric 'workflows.googleapis.com/finished_execution_count'
| filter (metric.status != 'SUCCEEDED')
| group_by 1d,
    [value_finished_execution_count_mean: mean(value.finished_execution_count)]
| every 1d
| condition val() > 0 '1'
```
